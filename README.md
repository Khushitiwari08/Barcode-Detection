# Barcode-Detection

The task involves implementing a robust barcode detection system in Python. The system is designed to analyze an image file specified by its path, employing OpenCV for image processing and the pyzbar library for barcode detection and decoding. The image is first converted to grayscale to facilitate efficient analysis. Subsequently, the pyzbar library is employed to identify and decode barcodes present in the image. For each successfully detected barcode, the system outlines a rectangle around it on the original image, providing a visual representation of the recognized codes. The processed image, complete with drawn rectangles, is then displayed using Matplotlib.
